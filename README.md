# Gon gem â€” get your Rails variables in your js

If you need to send some data to your js files and you don't want to do this with long way through views and parsing - use this force!

## Usage

`app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`

``` erb
<head>
  <title>some title</title>
  <%= include_gon %>
  <!-- include your action js code -->
  ...
```

In action of your controller you put something like this:

``` ruby
@your_int = 123
@your_array = [1,2]
@your_hash = {'a' => 1, 'b' => 2}
gon.your_int = @your_int
gon.your_other_int = 345 + gon.your_int
gon.your_array = @your_array
gon.your_array << gon.your_int
gon.your_hash = @your_hash

gon.all_variables # > {:your_int => 123, :your_other_int => 468, :your_array => [1, 2, 123], :your_hash => {'a' => 1, 'b' => 2}}
gon.your_array # > [1, 2, 123]

gon.clear # gon.all_variables now is {}
```

In javascript file for view of this action write call to your variable:

``` js
alert(gon.your_int)
alert(gon.your_other_int)
alert(gon.your_array)
alert(gon.your_hash)
```

## Installation

Puts this line into `Gemfile` then run `$ bundle`:

``` ruby
gem 'gon', '1.1.0'
```

Or if you are old-school Rails 2 developer put this into `config/environment.rb` and run `$ rake gems:install`:

``` ruby
config.gem 'gon', :version => '1.1.0'
```

Or manually install gon gem: `$ gem install gon`
